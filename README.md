# KONSTRUKT
Responsive Single-Page React + Vite Project with a Day/Night Switch.
In this project I tried to practice with React Intersection Observer, also have added day/night switch bacause the project would look even tinier without it.

using react-intersection-observer, react-icons, RTK, twin.macro
